# water-kg
All materials for constructing the knowledge representing water (surface and subsurface) features; i.e., anything to do with water and water networks (hydrology).

## Groundwater
Aquifers, wells, springs, etc. These generally come from individual states. For example, Maine has the Maine Geological Survey (MGS).

## Surface water
Waterbodies, like lakes, rivers, and wetlands. This information comes primarily from USGS NHDPlus data (NHDWaterbody).

## Flowlines
How surface waterbodies connect so water can flow. This is modeled from USGS NHDPlus data (NHDFlowline).
